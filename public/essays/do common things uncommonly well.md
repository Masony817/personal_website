It’s easy to overlook the power of doing simple things well. We live in a world obsessed with the new and flashy, and it can feel like everyone's chasing the next big thing. Quick attention grabs are dominating the economy, and attention is the new currency. But when you really look closely at some of the most successful people and companies, you’ll find that their success isn’t just about chasing down the next big thing. What they’re really good at is doing common things uncommonly well.

Take trades and independent contractors, for example. Electricians, plumbers, and mechanics aren’t reinventing the wheel. They’re taking the same tools and knowledge that have been around for generations and applying them with skill and precision. What makes them stand out isn’t the complexity of their work, but the quality with which they do it. People will always pay for the same services, but they will always want them done better and cheaper. These professionals show up on time, do the job right, and take pride in their work on the common things. Over time, they build reputations based on these seemingly simple tasks, and those reputations turn into a thriving business that supports their lives.

In tech, we see this same principle apply on a much larger scale. We hear a lot about innovation in the tech world, and it’s easy to think that innovation means coming up with completely new ideas. But, when you really break it down, tech is about organizing information, connecting people, and making processes more efficient. These are all basic concepts, but it’s the companies that figure out how to execute them exceptionally well that win. Facebook didn’t create social interaction, they just turned it into a sleek, easy-to-use product that revolutionized the way we socialize and consume media. Airbnb didn’t invent the idea of renting a room, but by doing the common thing uncommonly well, they turned it into a more accessible platform that is better for everyone involved. These companies never invented the wheel; they made the wheel roll smoother.

Though I’m still in the early stages of my journey as a founder, I’ve already seen how doing the basic things with discipline can lead to success, and how losing focus on the scope and fundamentals can bring the whole thing down. Over the past year and a half, I’ve worked on GoLocal, AdScratch, and now Kallro. I've focused on making simple, everyday experiences—finding local events, engaging with ads, and improving business communication—common things I have tried to do uncommonly well.

Take AdScratch, for example. Ads are something we all see every day, and most of us find them annoying or intrusive. I wanted to take that and turn it into a gamified, interactive experience. With GoLocal, I rethought how people discover and engage with local events. The goal wasn’t to create something brand new, but to make something familiar easier and more useful. Neither of those projects launched as planned, as Jay Shaffer told me, “Consumer is hard, Consumer social is harder.” But those experiences taught me invaluable lessons in timing, risk-taking, and the importance of work.

The real magic happens when you pay attention to the basics and do them better than anyone else. Whether it's taking something as mundane as making an ad more engaging or finding ways to improve a routine task, there’s real power in the common done uncommonly well. The key is to keep pushing forward, looking for ways to make something people want, and eventually, something significant will come out of it. Even if things don’t go as planned, the lessons and skills you gain from trying are just as valuable as the success you’re working toward.
